## My Projects
- üé• **Movie Review Sentiment Analysis System Project**
  - Developed a web application for analyzing user reviews about movies using a dataset of over 100,000 reviews (categorized as positive, negative, and neutral).
  - Used Random Forest and Logistic Regression to classify sentiments, splitting the data into a test set (20%) and a training set (80%).
  - Developed a web interface allowing users to input text and select the desired model. The system then predicts whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral and displays the results.
